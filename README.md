# Prized-Listeners-Frontend
Frontend repository for Prized Listeners web application. Prized Listeners aims to capitalize on everyone's love for music, and competition ;)

Meant to be a first full-stack project for my portfolio, I am targeting groups of friends who enjoy sharing music with one another. Being avid music listeners, we have all debated about who listens to and recommends the best music! This web application aims to answer that question for any group of friends.

Each week, a given user has one chance to recommend a song to a group of friends within the application, and these posts can receive 'upvotes'. Whichever post at the end of each week has the most upvotes wins the weekly competition. Our application will track wins for each user and display leaderboards to indicate who has the best taste in music that reaches all users' interests.

The initial state of this application will be one large user base voting on eachother's recommendations. However, once the application is established - I have plans to transition each group of users into their own 'space', sort of like GroupMe! So, that your friendly competition can be isolated amongst your friends.

As I continue to develop this project, there will be changes made to enhance the user experience and internal processes as I see fit. As I said earlier, this is my first full-stack project so please understand the turnaround on certain features may not be consistent with what large development teams offer.

Excited to begin the development process, and eager to hear your feedback! If you would like to contribute, feel free to shoot me a DM.
